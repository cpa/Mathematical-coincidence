It's quick'n'dirty.
Set the exploration depth in test.hs.

Compilation:
ghc --make -O2 test.hs
./test fileName outputs a LaTex file (pdflatex fileName.tex will create the pdf)

Near 0 values are ignored (because it is often (small number)/(large number))
Near -1,1 values are separated (because it is often (+/-)(number)**(near zero number))
